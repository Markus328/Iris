# What's this?
Iris dataset consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray

This project implements a far simple machine learning algorithm which tries to guess the irises's types through their petal and sepal length.
